                <p>Have you ever wondered why some music artists suddenly blow up out of nowhere? One day a song is all over TikTok, and the next day you're hearing it on the radio, and bleeding through other social platforms.</p>
                <p>It feels like every new artist is building their entire career on TikTok, but how much does impact does the platform really have? <span class="highlight">Can one viral TikTok song really launch a musician towards mainstream success?</span></p>
                <p>We aim to explore how TikTok activity relates to an artist's popularity on major music platforms, and whether viral moments truly translate into consistent success.</p>

                <h3>TikTok virality does not equate lasting success on Spotify.</h3>
                <p>Spotify is used as a metric of outside success of music on TikTok as it is the most popular music streaming service online with more than <span class="highlight"><a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/">713 million users worldwide.</a></span> In our digital age, music streaming services are the most accessible and dominant method of music consumption and can help exhibit sustained music consumption of users compared to the fast, instant, snippet consumption of music on TikTok.</p>
                <p>The most viral TikTok songs usually fail to translate their massive viewership into proportionate success on streaming services. For instance, looking at the most popular songs on TikTok we can see are <span class="highlight">“Monkey Spinning Monkeys” by Kevin Macleod</span>, and <span class="highlight">“Love You So” by The King Khan and BBQ Show.</span> These songs are highly popular as trending sounds, but most listeners are not listening to them at their full length. This indicates the music functioned primarily as effective <span class="highlight">background audio</span> for a visual trend, rather than for listening.</p>
                <p>In contrast, global hits such as “As It Was” by Harry Styles and “Stay (with Justin Bieber)” by The Kid LAROI have massive Spotify streams at around 3 billion, with only around 40 billion TikTok views.</p>

                <h3>TikTok allows for great reach and can spread tracks to a wide audience.</h3>
                <p>Surprisingly, the most popular songs on TikTok are songs you've never even heard of. Mundane, royalty-free backing tracks that are ultimately there to keep the viewer company.</p>
                <p>While you can see that the most viral TikTok songs <span class="highlight">do poorly on other platforms</span> such as Spotify and Youtube, you can also notice that TikTok is all about reach. TikTok has much greater exposure of tracks to listeners compared to the other platforms, as TikTok is a much larger platform with over <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241788/tiktok-app-download-numbers-update-2-billion-users">2 billion users.</a></span></p>
                <p>The ultra viral tracks have lacking conversion to other platforms, but in the middle you can see songs like “Stay (With Justin Bieber)” and “love nwantiti (ah ah ah)” have decent <span class="highlight">stable conversion</span> to platforms of Spotify and Youtube. This data shows that while there isn't total reliance on TikTok towards cultivating a fanbase, TikTok can mainly be used as a promotional tool leading to some conversion of streams on Youtube/Spotify.</p>

                <h3>How does TikTok impact 3 vastly different artists?</h3>
                <p>To explore the complex relationship between TikTok exposure and sustained success, we took a look thru the lens of three artists with varied patterns of success on TikTok: <span class="highlight">bbno$</span> with virality mainly on TikTok, <span class="highlight">Sabrina Carpenter</span> with success across all platforms, and <span class="highlight">Hozier</span> with lower TikTok success, but high streaming success.</p>

                    <div id="view3"></div>
                </div>

                <p>Sabrina Carpenter's viral TikTok hit, “Espresso” while has about <span class="highlight">3x more TikTok views than Spotify streams</span>. While not the most viral sound on TikTok, this song has <span class="highlight">efficient and balanced</span> conversion rates from the platform to Spotify.</p>
                <p>Hozier's “Take Me to Church” has approximately 2.5 billion Spotify Streams, this track's success has longevity, and fan loyalty. But it has <span class="highlight">low reliance</span> on current TikTok trends to contribute to its growth. Hozier represents Streaming Dominant success and displays the music industry's benchmark of success through sustained, stable appeal, independent of social media virality.</p>
                <p>bbno$'s “edamame (feat. Rich Brian) has by far the most staggering TikTok virality with views at around 5.5 billion views and <span class="highlight">dominating the platform</span>'s engagement metrics. Yet, its conversion to Spotify Streams is alarmingly low, <span class="highlight">massive exposure on TikTok is not the same as consumption</span>.</p>

                <h3>Each artist's drastically different TikTok engagement metrics.</h3>
                <p>A dive into the TikTok metrics shows that “edamame”, although it is the most dominant track on TikTok with over 6 billion total interactions, this volume of activity displays a dramatically <span class="highlight">low conversion rate</span> exhibited on streaming platforms. This disparity shows that users are engaging with the song as an <span class="highlight">audio tool for trends</span>, rather than music leisurely consumed at full length, leading to disconnect between its huge reach and actual commercial success.</p>

                <h3>How successful is each artist on Spotify + Youtube + TikTok?</h3>
                <p>As you can see for bbno$, he has extremely high TikTok views and that is his primary channel of engagement with around 5.7 billion TikTok views, while his Spotify streams and YouTube streams are relatively low with only 460 million Spotify streams, and 129 million YouTube. This imbalance demonstrates a failure to convert exposure into loyalty, confirming that most TikTok viewers  engage with the song as a trend audio, not seeking out the full track for listening outside the platform.</p>
                <p>Hozier has half of his engagement be Spotify streams with around 2.5 billion streams, and the other half primarily YouTube (1.7 billion) and finally TikTok (261 million). As Hozier is an older artist with preexisting success, he has less reliance on TikTok and incentive to obtain visibility on the platform. It also displays the power of his loyal, established fanbase that are consistently consuming his music on dedicated streaming services.</p>
                <p>For Sabrina Carpenter we can see the dominance in TikTok (1.3 billion), but she also has good success among Spotify (547 million) and Youtube (107 million). As she is an artist that has recently achieved mainstream success,  her balanced performance across platforms proves that while it is difficult, it is still possible for newer mainstream hits to convert massive TikTok exposure into sustained, consumption on music streaming platforms.</p>

            <div class="content-2">
                <h2>Final Takeaways.</h2>
                <p>Our core finding is that large viral success on TikTok does not guarantee proportionate, sustained success on dedicated streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube. Our current digital music landscape relies on high streaming numbers, but artists are fueled by having successful conversion gaps bridging exposure and loyalty.</p>
                <p>The most viral TikTok hits consistently hit a wall on streaming platforms. For instance, bbno$'s "edamame" had a ratio of roughly 12.6 TikTok Views for every 1 Spotify Stream, displaying that billions of engagements on TikTok can be amassed without gaining real dedicated listeners.</p>
                <p>TikTok is primarily a discovery tool where songs are snippeted and used as background audio for trends and videos. Its widespread reach helps artists gain traction, but fails to motivate many users to actively seek out and stream the full song the majority of times.</p>
                <p>However, a rare few artists show that conversion is possible. Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso" achieved efficient conversion rates. While it is not the most viral track overall on TikTok, its success demonstrates that listeners were willing to move from the casual TikTok environment to Spotify.</p>
